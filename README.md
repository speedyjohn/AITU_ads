# Algorithms and Data Structures: Functions and Recursion(Assigment 1)

This repository contains a Java application developed for assigment 1 at Astana IT University in the course "Algorithms and Data Structures". It demonstrates various algorithms implemented using functions and recursion

## Description
This program can perform the following tasks:

- Calculation of the minimum value within an array
- Determination of the average value of an array
- Primality test for an input number
- Computation of factorial of a given number
- Generation of the nth Fibonacci sequence number
- Exponentiation of a number to a given power
- Reversal of a sequence of numbers
- Validation that a string consists only of digits
- Computation of the binomial coefficient (n choose k)
- Calculation of the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm
